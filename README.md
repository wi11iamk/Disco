# Disco
Dimensionality reduction of human pose data for synergy discovery

Use of disco.py requires full installations of [miniconda3](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/), [DeepLabCut](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/installation.html), and [HUB-DT](https://github.com/Loken85/HUB_DT). 

Disco was developed to analyse data for a PhD thesis. Disco leverages functions from HUB-DT, DeepLabCut, as well as those of my own creation. Disco was assembled and tested on a Macbook Pro 16, M3 Max, 64GB RAM.
