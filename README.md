# disco
Dimensionality reduction of human pose data for synergy discovery

Use of disco.py requires full installations of [miniconda3](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/), [DeepLabCut](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/installation.html), and [HUB-DT](https://github.com/Loken85/HUB_DT).

Disco was developed to analyse data for my PhD thesis. Disco leverages functions from HUB-DT, DeepLabCut, and several of my own creation. Disco was assembled and tested on a Macbook Pro 16, M3 Max, 64GB RAM, using Sonoma 14.3.1, Python 3.8.18, and Spyder 5.4.3.
